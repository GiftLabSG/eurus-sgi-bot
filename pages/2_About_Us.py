st.markdown("### 🧩 Problem Statement")
st.write("""
Security agencies in Singapore face a fragmented landscape when it comes to navigating available government grants. 
These grants—covering areas like technology adoption, workforce upskilling, and digital transformation—are scattered 
across multiple websites and agencies. This makes it difficult for agencies to access relevant, timely, and actionable 
information to support their growth and transformation goals.
""")

st.markdown("### 💡 Proposed Solution")
st.write("""
**Eurus - SGI (Security Grant Initiative)** is an AI-powered assistant designed to simplify the grant discovery process.

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Eurus continuously gathers and updates information from official government 
sources through web scraping and manual curation. The assistant can:

- Answer user queries about grants, including **eligibility, objectives, application steps, and more**
- Recommend **complementary or bundled grants** based on the agency's needs
- Offer **human escalation** options when the assistant cannot provide an answer

The goal is to provide an intuitive, always-accessible, and accurate solution for security agencies seeking funding 
opportunities to innovate and grow.
